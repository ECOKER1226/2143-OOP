## Json Database Project

### Ezekiel Coker

### Project Description
This program implements a JSON-based database system for managing
structured user records. The JsonDB class provides essential CRUD
operations, handling file interactions and ensuring data integrity.
Building on this, the PeopleDB subclass specializes in managing
"people" data, allowing searches by attributes like name, phone,
email, and location. With a modular design, the system is easy to
maintain, extend, and test through if __name__ == "main":,
working directly with real data in random_people.10000.json.
